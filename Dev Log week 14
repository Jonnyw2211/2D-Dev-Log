Dev Log Week 14
Interview- My feedback was overall positive however maybes could do more internal research and look into exclusive projects ran by the interviewer and learn about them inside and out
I was confident and knowledgeable in the subject matters and i had answers prepared for the style of questions i was asked. 
The only thing i want to analyse going forward is my mannerisms and how to convey my answers as confidently as possible
